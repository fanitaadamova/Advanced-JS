In the "JS Advanced" course, you will get a deep knowledge of the JavaScript language, such as the basics of syntax, working with arrays, matrices, objects, classes and writing functions. You will study more complex concepts like function context, explicit binding, event loop. The course will develop your algorithmic thinking. After successful completion of this course, you will be able to work with the DOM tree, do manipulations on it and work with "events". Functional and OOP approaches to JavaScript programming will be explored, studying concepts such as inheritance, object composition, and prototype chaining.
